# HTML

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language was created by a developer named Tim Berners-Lee in 1991.

Today, HTML is used on every website in the world; it's the base structure underneath all your favorite sites. However, HTML is just one piece that is used to build a web page. 

Most web pages use:

Html : Create the website skeleton.
CSS: Modify the website presentation.
JavaScript: Make it interactive.


As the name suggests, HTML is a markup language; it marks up every piece of content on a web page and defines its type. The language is simple and perfect for beginners!


All the programs we write will be HTML files with the file extension .html.
